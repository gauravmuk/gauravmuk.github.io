  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / Tech-Utilitarian
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Radical Transparency**: Expose the "source code" of the career (metrics, failures, learnings).
  2. **High Contrast & Boldness**: Unapologetic use of size and weight to guide attention.
  3. **System Over Story**: Present career as a system of inputs and outputs rather than a linear narrative.
  4. **Raw Authenticity**: Avoid corporate polish; embrace the "work in progress" aesthetic.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Stark white (#ffffff) or deep charcoal (#1d1d1d) - high contrast base.
  - **Primary**: Electric Blue (#0055FF) or Hyper-Green (#00FF94) - signaling digital energy and code execution.
  - **Accent**: Warning Yellow (#FFD700) or Error Red (#FF4444) - used for emphasis and "debug" notes.
  - **Intent**: To evoke the feeling of a terminal, a blueprint, or a raw development environment. It says "I build things that work."

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid / Dashboard**: Content is organized in distinct, bordered modules like a bento box or a dashboard.
  - **Asymmetry**: Break the grid intentionally to highlight key achievements.
  - **Sticky Elements**: Navigation or key stats that persist like a HUD (Heads-Up Display).

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Monospace Typography**: Used for headers and data points to reinforce the engineering focus.
  - **Visible Borders & Lines**: 1px solid borders separating sections, reminiscent of spreadsheets or wireframes.
  - **"Raw" Data Visualizations**: Bar charts or git-contribution-style graphs integrated directly into the layout.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover States**: Elements react sharply (invert colors, hard shifts) rather than fading.
  - **Micro-interactions**: Buttons click with a mechanical feel; toggles snap.
  - **Cursor Effects**: A custom cursor that might change shape or reveal data on hover.

  **Animation**:
  - **Instant / Step**: Animations are snappy (0.1s - 0.2s), avoiding ease-in-out curves. Things appear, slide in linearly, or type out.
  - **Glitch / Reveal**: Subtle glitch effects on hover or section load to emphasize the "digital" nature.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Space Mono** or **JetBrains Mono** (Bold, Uppercase) - Technical, authoritative.
  - **Body**: **Inter** or **DM Sans** (Regular) - Clean, readable, balancing the harshness of the headers.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (Digital Evolution)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Objective Clarity**: Content is king; design is the invisible vessel.
  2. **Mathematical Grids**: Rigorous adherence to a grid system for order and harmony.
  3. **Asymmetric Balance**: Dynamic compositions that feel stable but not centered.
  4. **Universal Communication**: Use of icons and simple forms to transcend language.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Off-white / Cream (#F5F5F0) or Soft Gray (#EFEFEF) - warm, paper-like.
  - **Primary**: Swiss Red (#FF3B30) or International Blue (#007AFF) - classic, bold, functional.
  - **Neutral**: Dark Gray (#333333) for text - softer than pure black.
  - **Intent**: To convey professionalism, precision, and timelessness. It says "I value structure and clarity."

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Multi-Column Grid**: Text and images span varying column widths (e.g., 3/12 for labels, 9/12 for content).
  - **Whitespace as Structure**: Large margins and padding define relationships between elements.
  - **Horizontal Scroll**: For project galleries or timelines to break the vertical flow.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Huge Typography**: Oversized headings that act as graphic elements.
  - **Geometric Shapes**: Simple circles, squares, and lines used for decoration or emphasis.
  - **Photography**: High-quality, black and white or desaturated photos with colored overlays.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smooth & Fluid**: Transitions are seamless and elegant.
  - **Parallax**: Subtle depth between text and background elements on scroll.
  - **Focus**: Hovering over an item dims the rest of the page to focus attention.

  **Animation**:
  - **Ease & Flow**: Elements float into place with gentle easing (0.4s - 0.6s).
  - **Staggered Reveal**: Content loads in a cascaded sequence (text line by line).

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Helvetica Now Display** or **Neue Haas Grotesk** (Heavy/Black) - The gold standard of Swiss design.
  - **Body**: **Helvetica Now Text** or **Roboto** (Regular) - Neutral, legible.

  **Design Movement**: Glassmorphism / Ethereal Tech
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Depth & Layering**: Creating a sense of 3D space on a 2D screen.
  2. **Light & Shadow**: Using light sources to define form and hierarchy.
  3. **Softness & Approachability**: Rounded corners and blurred backgrounds to feel organic.
  4. **Future-Forward**: A vision of technology that is seamless and integrated.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Deep gradients (Midnight Blue to Purple) or Aurora Borealis effects.
  - **Glass**: Translucent white/black with background blur (backdrop-filter).
  - **Accents**: Neon gradients (Cyan to Magenta) for buttons and highlights.
  - **Intent**: To evoke innovation, creativity, and the "magic" of software. It says "I create experiences."

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Floating Cards**: Content lives on cards that float above the background.
  - **Z-Axis Navigation**: Elements might move forward/backward in space.
  - **Fluid Containers**: Sections that don't have hard edges but blend into each other.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Frosted Glass**: Used for navigation bars, cards, and overlays.
  - **Glowing Orbs**: Abstract light sources moving slowly in the background.
  - **3D Icons/Illustrations**: Rendered objects that float in the layout.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons press down; cards lift up on hover.
  - **Mouse Follow**: Subtle lighting effects that follow the cursor.
  - **Immersive Scroll**: The background evolves as the user scrolls down.

  **Animation**:
  - **Float & Bob**: Elements have a gentle, continuous floating motion.
  - **Blur In**: Content fades in while unblurring.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Outfit** or **Plus Jakarta Sans** (Bold) - Modern, geometric, friendly.
  - **Body**: **Satoshi** or **Urbanist** (Regular) - Clean, contemporary.
